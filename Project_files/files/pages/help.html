<h3>Instructions</h3>
<pre>
    The website gives you a few options for filling out your invoice. You can look at the invoice preview on the right side
    to make sure all the information are in the place you want them to be. If the input field are not enough to get your desired
    setup, you can use the <b>Direct Edit</b> button, and manually edit the preview. It is better to turn off the direct edit
    mode when you are not using it to avoid unwanted changes.
</pre>
<h4>How to use:</h4>
<pre>
    You can fill out the input boxes on the left side and click on the <b>"Update Preview"</b> button to update the invoice preview

    In order to fill in your items, you can use the Direct Edit mode and fill in the items directly.
    After filling out your items, you can click on the <b>Calculate</b> and the program will calculate the total.
